# 🗂️ Data Lake Application  

## 📖 Project Description  
This project demonstrates the creation of a scalable and efficient **Data Lake** using AWS services. The application is designed to ingest, store, process, and analyze large volumes of data, enabling real-time insights and analytics.  

With this project, I explored event-driven architecture and serverless computing, leveraging AWS tools to build a robust solution for managing data streams effectively.

## 🛠️ Features  
- **Data Ingestion**: Stream real-time data into the data lake using AWS Kinesis.  
- **ETL Processing**: Transform raw data into structured formats using AWS Glue.  
- **Data Storage**: Store raw and processed data securely in AWS S3.  
- **Query and Analysis**: Perform SQL-like queries on the data lake using AWS Athena.  
- **Scalability**: Built to handle large-scale data with minimal operational overhead.
